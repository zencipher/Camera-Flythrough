# Camera Flythrough
This project allows the user to travel through 3 curves which are BSplines generated from the lines manually placed in the scene. 'Q' 'W' 'E' keyes are the control keys which allow you to travel through the left, middle, and right curves respectively. The scene also includes a hot-air balloon which also travels along a BSpline above. The balloon can be animated with the 'D' button.

## About

### Note of Warning
Instructors are beginning to use [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to catch cheaters. If you are a student looking here with the intent of copying this code, proceed with caution. Considering that this project in particular requires the creation of an **_original object_** (even if you load in premade models), it would be blatantly obvious if you use this code for reference, **HOWEVER**, using this as reference for rotations, transformations, and camera modes is perfectly fine.
